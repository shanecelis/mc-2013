* Working on results-15
** 4f is not using FODE with the sandwich. It has a leftward bias due to Bullet.
** Bullet left-bias needs to be fixed.  It should not move when it starts.    
** Running 4f-a-* with fode-physics and sandwich.  It should be symmetric.  It is.
   The sandwich is not symmetric, that's ok because the CTRNN is
   idiosyncratic
** Ran 4f-b which includes multiple vehicles.
** Running 4f-c which has a range of 0.25.
